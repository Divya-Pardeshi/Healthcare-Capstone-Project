# Healthcare-Capstone-Project
This repository contains code and documentation for a project aimed at predicting diabetes in patients based on various diagnostic measurements. The project uses machine learning techniques to develop models capable of accurately predicting whether a patient has diabetes or not.

## Project Overview

The project is based on data provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). The dataset includes medical predictor variables such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, insulin levels, and more, along with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

### Objective

The primary objective is to build and evaluate predictive models that can accurately classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on the provided medical data.

## Project Structure

### Data Exploration (Week 1)
- **Descriptive Analysis:** Understanding the variables, exploring missing values, and visualizing the distributions of key features.
- **Data Balance Check:** Analyzing the distribution of outcome classes and addressing data imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Pairwise scatter plots and correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables.

### Data Modeling (Week 2)
- **Model Building:** Implementing various classification algorithms including KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Naive Bayes.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, ROC AUC, and confusion matrices.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the Random Forest model using Randomized Search CV for improved performance.
